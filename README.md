# IFoundThePhone

IFoundThePhone is a website that helps people recover their lost devices. Specifically, it makes it much easier for a person who finds a lost device to return it to the owner. When you sign up, you are sent an email that contains a QR code. Set the QR code as the lock screen of your phone. When someone finds your device, they can scan the QR code and are redirected to a page that allows them to enter a message and any other relevant contact information. This information is then emailed to the device owner.
